Generic Web Article Generator Using Project Oxford API

This was just a side-project driven by an interest in speech generation.
This is basically a poor-man's RNN.  At one point, Microsoft had a collection of APIs known as the "Project Oxford APIs".  
One of the endpoints would take in a phrase consisting of a few words and then return an array of possible following words with associated probabilities.
This project used that endpoint to randomly generate phrases to see if anything interesting would get generated.  The methodology wasn't very effective for generating real speech, but it was a fun simple project.
